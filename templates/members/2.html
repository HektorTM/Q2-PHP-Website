		<h2 class="heading-line">Paul Gray</h2>
		<p>
			Paul Dedrick Gray (April 8, 1972 ï¿½ May 24, 2010) was the bass player of the band up till May 24th, 2010, and was part of the original Slipknot line-up. Unlike the rest of the band (except Jim),
			he was in fact born in Los Angeles, but he resided in Des Moines Iowa with the rest of the band.</p>
		<h2 class="heading-line"> Life and career </h2>
		<p>
			Gray was born in Los Angeles, California. Later his family relocated to Des Moines, Iowa. In his youth, Gray performed in bands such as Anal Blast,
			Vexx, Body Pit and, Inveigh Catharsi. Outside Slipknot, Gray has filled in as bassist for Unida during their 2003 tour, appeared on Drop Dead,
			Gorgeous' Worse Than a Fairy Tale, done a brief tour with Reggie and the Full Effect and appeared on the Roadrunner United project, performing
			bass on "The Enemy" and "Baptized in the Redemption" from the project's album The All-Star Sessions.
		</p>
		<p>
			In June 2003 Gray crashed his car into another vehicle. After police were called to the scene and searched his car, Gray was arrested for possession of cocaine,
			marijuana, drug paraphernalia, and failure to obey a traffic signal. Turmoil was caused within Slipknot's fanbase when Gray's mugshot from the incident surfaced,
			as at this time, with the exception of Corey Taylor and guitarist James Root, unobstructed photographs of most members of the band's faces were exceptionally rare. 
			He was one of the 3 of Slipknot's founding line-up that remained in the band, and the only one who maintained his original role in the band due to Clown's switch 
			from main drums to custom percussion during the early days. He is one of the two members not born in Iowa (the other is Jim Root, who was born in Las Vegas).
			Paul has been married for two years to GodsGirls, Brenna, Paul has a tattoo of her name on his knuckles. Paul and Brenna were expecting their first child in 2010. 
			Paul made the announcement on his Myspace account. On August 17, 2010, Brenna gave birth to their daughter October Dedrick Gray.
		</p>
		<h2 class="heading-line">Death</h2>
		<p>
			On May 24, 2010, The Des Moines Register reported that Gray had been found dead at a room in the Town Plaza Hotel in Urbandale, Iowa.
			He is survived by his wife Brenna. He and his wife were expecting their first child at the time of his death. His autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday,
			May 25th, as the cause of death is Morphine overdose.
